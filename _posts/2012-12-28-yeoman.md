[Yeoman][1] serves to help us create a modern workflow for building modern applications. In this episode, we will create a little project on terminologies related to [object-oriented programming (oop)][2] that will help us explore the main features of Yeoman such as scaffolding, compiling into css and js, linting, starting a local web server, image optimisation and so much more!
