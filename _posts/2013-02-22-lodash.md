[Lodash][1] is a utlity belt javascript library. It is also a hard dependancy for [Backbonejs][2], as a drop-in replacement for [underscorejs][3] with performance enhancement. In this episode we will create a simple project using some functions of lodash along with its micro templating features. We will also explore the custom build functions and source maps.
