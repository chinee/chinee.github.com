[Closure][1] is a set of tools developed by Google and the [Closure Compiler][2] is part of it for JavaScript optimisation and minification. In this episode, we will take a simple JavaScript project about CSS colors and run it through the various features of Closure! We will also use the [Closure Lint][3] and check our code.
