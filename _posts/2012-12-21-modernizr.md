[Modernizr][1] is a library for detecting whether the userâ€™s browsers have certain features and based on the availability, we developers will trigger certain functions or styles. In this episode, we will take a simple slideshow and use both javascript and css3 to make the transitions based on features available with libraries such as [yepnope][2] and [html5shiv][3]. Most importantly, we will scratch the surface of what is [graceful degradation][4] and [progressive enhancement][5].
